# Routines V1 — Tutorial

V1 routines are multi-step pipelines: a single routine can fetch data, run
an LLM against it, write the result somewhere, and persist a snippet of
state for the next run. Each routine can have multiple triggers (cron,
webhook, manual) and a budget cap. This walk-through gets you from zero to a
working daily-briefing in a few minutes.

## Quickest path: install the daily-briefing template

The fastest way to see a V1 routine in action:

```bash
# List shipped templates
curl http://127.0.0.1:8787/api/routine-templates

# Install one
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8787/api/routine-templates/daily-briefing
```

That creates a routine in **disabled** state. Open the deck at
`/routines`, click the new entry, and you'll see the **Builder** tab with all
7 steps, the **Triggers** tab with its cron + webhook, the **Settings** tab
with the budget caps, and the **Spec (YAML)** tab with the raw spec.

To run it once on demand:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8787/api/routines/<id>/run
```

Or just click **Run now** in the editor. Once it's finished, the routine creates
a new **capture item in the deck's native Inbox** (`/inbox`, kind=`capture`).

## Author one yourself in the visual builder

1. Open `/routines` and click **New routine**.
2. The header shows two mode pills — **pipeline** (V1) and **single-action**
   (legacy V0). New routines default to pipeline.
3. **Settings** tab: set a name, optionally a description, concurrency,
   timezone, tags, and budget caps.
4. **Triggers** tab: add at least one trigger (cron / webhook / manual).
   Cron entries get a live "next 3 runs" preview against the IANA timezone
   you set.
5. **Steps** tab: click **+ Add step** and pick a type. Each card has the
   shared fields (`id`, `when`, `on_failure`, `retry`, `timeout_secs`) on
   top, then the type-specific fields underneath. Up/down arrows reorder.
6. Toggle **Enabled** in the footer, then **Create**.

The **Spec (YAML)** tab shows the same routine as raw YAML. Edit there and
click **Apply to form** to sync the changes back — useful for advanced
patterns the form doesn't expose (deeply nested transforms, complex
templating).

## The 9 step types

| type        | use                                                                                      |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `run`       | shell out to a command, capture stdout/stderr                                            |
| `agent`     | prompt the omp SDK; costs LLM tokens                                                     |
| `write`     | write a templated string to a file (overwrite or append)                                 |
| `http`      | GET / POST / PUT / PATCH / DELETE against a URL; internal calls get an HMAC bearer token |
| `deck`      | mutate deck-native state without hand-rolling API calls (`create_inbox_item`, `create_task`, `move_task`, `promote_inbox_item_to_task`) |
| `transform` | JS expression in a quickjs sandbox; sets `steps.<id>.json`                               |
| `set_state` | UPSERT key/value pairs into the routine's persistent state                               |
| `wait`      | sleep N seconds (useful between polling steps)                                           |
| `mcp`       | invoke an MCP server tool — stubbed in V1, lands in V1.5                                 |

Every step type has the shared fields:

- `id` — referenced by downstream steps via `steps.<id>.json`, `.stdout`, `.stderr`
- `when` — a JS expression evaluated in the sandbox; if it returns falsy, the
  step is skipped
- `on_failure` — `abort` (default), `continue`, `retry`
- `retry` — `{ times, backoff: linear | exponential, max_delay_secs?, after_retry? }`
- `timeout_secs` — per-step wall-clock cap

## Templating

The runner exposes a `{{ expr }}` template surface for string fields:

- `{{ run.id }}` — opaque run ID, prefixed `run_`
- `{{ run.date }}` — `YYYY-MM-DD` in the routine's timezone
- `{{ run.started }}` — ISO start timestamp
- `{{ trigger.kind }}` — `cron` | `manual` | `webhook` | `event`
- `{{ trigger.payload.<field> }}` — webhook body or manual params
- `{{ steps.<id>.json.<field> }}` — structured output (e.g. parsed HTTP response)
- `{{ steps.<id>.stdout }}` — captured stdout text
- `{{ state.<key> }}` — persisted state from prior runs (or `set_state` earlier this run)
- `{{ env.NAME }}` — environment variable
- `{{ secrets.NAME }}` — env var, but redacted in logs

Helpers: `{{ steps.X.json | json }}` (JSON-stringify), `{{ items | length }}`.

In a single-expression payload (e.g. an HTTP body), the value is preserved
as its native type, not coerced to a string.

## Triggers

A routine can have multiple triggers, even of the same kind. Examples:

```yaml
trigger:
  - cron: "0 7 * * *"          # 7am daily
  - cron: "0 17 * * 1-5"       # 5pm weekdays
  - webhook:
      path: /hooks/refresh
      secret_env: REFRESH_SECRET
  - manual: {}
```

Cron expressions are 5-field standard (minute / hour / day / month / weekday).
Set `timezone:` on the spec to evaluate against an IANA zone like
`America/Chicago`.

For webhook triggers, click **Rotate secret** in the routine's Settings tab
to mint a fresh server-side secret. The plaintext is shown **once** —
the server only persists a hash. Callers must sign the request body with:

```
X-Routine-Signature: sha256=<hex>
```

where `<hex>` is `HMAC-SHA256(secret, body)`.

## Concurrency

What happens when a trigger fires while a previous run is in flight:

- `skip` (default): drop the new fire
- `queue`: queue it; run after the current one finishes
- `cancel-previous`: abort the in-flight run, start the new one
- `parallel`: run concurrently (costs add up)

## Budget

`max_duration_secs`, `max_llm_cost_usd`, `max_llm_tokens_input`,
`max_llm_tokens_output`, `max_steps_executed`. Checked between steps. On
excess the runner hard-aborts with `abort_reason: 'budget'` and persists
partial results.

Cost estimation comes from a static price table — treat it as an estimate,
not an invoice. Your LLM vendor's bill is authoritative.

## Cross-run state

Persistent key-value store scoped per routine:

```yaml
state:
  declared_keys: [last_seen_id]
steps:
  - id: should_run
    type: transform
    body: |
      if (state.last_seen_id === run.id) return { ok: false };
      return { ok: true };
  - id: do_thing
    type: run
    when: steps.should_run.json.ok
    command: ./script.sh
  - id: persist
    type: set_state
    state:
      last_seen_id: "{{ run.id }}"
```

`declared_keys` is informational — the runtime can write any key via
`set_state`. State writes are atomic per step.

## Observability

- Routine detail page → **Runs** section lists recent runs.
- Click a run → `/routines/:id/runs/:runId` opens **RunDetailView** with a
  live-polling timeline. Click any step to expand stdout / stderr /
  structured JSON / error.
- `GET /api/routines/:id/metrics` returns success rate, p50/p95 duration,
  MTD cost, and a last-30 sparkline series.

## Programmatic install

If you'd rather not click through the builder:

```bash
# Author the spec as a YAML file
cat > /tmp/my-routine.yaml <<'YAML'
name: hello-world
description: minimal one-step routine
trigger:
  - manual: {}
concurrency: skip
steps:
  - id: greet
    type: run
    command: 'echo "hello from {{ run.id }}"'
YAML

curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8787/api/routines \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d "$(jq -Rs '{ name: "hello-world", cron: "", actionKind: "bash", actionBody: "", specYaml: . }' < /tmp/my-routine.yaml)"
```

The server validates the YAML against the JSON Schemas in
`packages/protocol/src/schemas/` and returns 400 with a list of schema
errors if anything is off.

## Limitations in V1

- The `mcp` step type is **stubbed**. It validates at the schema level but
  fails at runtime with a clear V1.5 pointer. Use an `agent` step with
  `mcp_servers_allowed: [server-name]` instead — the SDK's MCP client tracks
  state via `~/.omp/agent/mcp.json` and the agent has access to those tools.
- DnD step reordering lands in V1.5. Up/down arrows work today.
- No "test this step in isolation" runner yet — full re-run is the only
  way to debug. Coming in V2.
- Windows console codepage mangles em-dashes in `agent` step stdout
  (cosmetic; the briefing is fully usable).

## What's next (V1.5)

- Workspace MCP integration: Gmail / Calendar / Drive / Docs via the
  [taylorwilsdon/google_workspace_mcp](https://github.com/taylorwilsdon/google_workspace_mcp)
  server. Inbox-triager is the V1.5 proof point.
- Real `mcp` step type with `server` + `tool` dropdowns sourced from
  installed MCP servers.
- Drag-and-drop step reordering with smart warnings when a reorder breaks
  a downstream context reference.
- Per-step "Test this step" runner against the last-run context.
